Getting Started:
----------------
Unzip the included files to a folder.
Compile and run using 'run' scripts listed below.

File Descriptions:
------------------
readme.txt          // this file

----Project files----
arch_package.sv     // Defines parameters, enums and structures for DDR4.
arch_defines.v      // Defines chip sizes and widths.
ddr4_model.svp       // Defines ideal DDR4 dram behavior.
dimm_interface.sv   // Defines component and module interfaces
MemoryArray.svp      // Defines 'class MemoryArray'.
proj_package.sv     // Defines parameters, enums and structures for this
                    // specific DDR4.
StateTable.svp       // Wrapper around StateTableCore which creates 
                    // 'module StateTable'.
StateTableCore.svp   // Dram state core functionality.
timing_tasks.sv     // Defines enums and timing parameters for 
                    // available speed grades.

----Testbench----
dimm_tb.sv          // ddr4 module test bench.
dimm_subtest.vh     // Example test included by the test bench.

----Compile and run scripts----
run_dimm_modelsim        // Compiles and runs for modelsim (uses modelsim.do).
run_dimm_ncverilog       // Compiles and runs for ncverilog.
run_dimm_vcs             // Compiles and runs for vcs.
modelsim_dimm.do         // For use with modelsim.

Defining the Organization:
--------------------------
The verilog compiler directive "`define" may be used to choose between 
multiple organizations supported by the ddr4 model.
Valid organizations include: "X4", "X8", and "X16".
Valid sizes include: "2G", "4G", "8G", and "16G".
These two parameters are combined to define the organization tested. 
For example DDR4_4G_X8. Please see arch_defines.v for examples.
The following are examples of defining the organization.

    simulator   command line
    ---------   ------------
    ModelSim    vlog +define+DDR4_2G_X8 ddr4_model.svp [additional files]
    NC-Verilog  ncverilog +define+DDR4_2G_X8 ddr4_model.svp [additional files]
    VCS         vcs +define+DDR4_2G_X8 ddr4_model.svp [additional files]

All combinations of size and organization are considered valid 
by the ddr4 model even though a Micron part may not exist for every 
combination.

The default module is single rank without ECC. Therefore the configuration is x64 DQ, x8 DQS, x8 DM (if applicable).
To enable ECC use +define+ECC
To enable dual rank use +define+DUAL_RANK

Use these +define parameters for debugging:
MODEL_DEBUG_MEMORY  // Prints messages for every read and write to the memory core.
MODEL_DEBUG_CMDS    // Prints messages for every command/clk on the dram bus.
